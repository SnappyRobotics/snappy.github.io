***Mechanical Component Design:***Here each mechanical component is broken down to describe in detail exactly how it will perform its piece of processing.

**Heat sink:**This is designed to absorb the excessive or unwanted heat generated.It exchanges heat generated by the processor to the air.A heat sink is designed to increase the surface area in contact with the cooling fluid surrounding it, such as the air.The factors which affect the thermal performance of a heat sink are air velocity, choice of material, fin design and surface treatment.
Thermal resistance is temperature rise per unit of power(°C/W).The contact between the casing and heat sink may have a thermal resistance of between 0.5 up to 1.7 °C/W
The materials that can be used are Copper,Aluminium,Diamond etc.The material used for heat sink is Aluminium alloys 6060 or 6063 with thermal conductivity values of 166 and 201 W/m•K

**Casing**
The casing is designed to avoid shorting.It is designed so that the board is not affected by external factors. The designed case is be able to
- Enclose all the circuit parts
- Easily extended with additional sensors, motors, and functionalities
- Easy to modify
- Easy to disassemble all the parts
- Limit the need for soldering and gluing  
The material used for casing is  Economical 5052 H32 aluminum. It is excellent in a variety of industrial applications such as; solar battery storage, telecommunication cabinets, lift stations, traffic control equipment and water and waste water treatment applications.  
Enclosures need to perform well in harsh, high-heat, high-wear environments are generally made of strong and durable aluminum alloys.Casing is designed in such a way that it has proper opening for heat dissipation.
