***Node-RED*** is a software tool developed by IBM for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services as part of the Internet of Things.Node-RED provides a browser-based flow editor, which can be used to create JavaScript functions. Elements of applications can be saved or shared for re-use. The runtime is built on Node.js. The flows created in Node-RED are stored using JSON.
The nodes are created for Differential drive, Omni drive, Synchronous drive and Mapping.
- Differential drive: The code is written such that the functioning of the motors as per input given like forward,backward, left and right should be done correctly.
- Omni drive: The code is written for inputs given like front,back, left and right for functioning of the motors which should be done correctly.
- Synchronous drive: The code is written such that the functioning of the motors as per input given like forward,backward, left and right should be done correctly.
- Mapping: The code is written such that the voltage reading acquired is converted as per the scale fixed to get the exact data.

This nodes are used to create a window through GUI where all these nodes will be displayed
